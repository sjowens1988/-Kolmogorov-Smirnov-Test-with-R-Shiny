# -Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Test-with-R-Shiny
R-Shiny App that computes the KS statistic for 2 distributions, plots QQ plot, and the two density plots.

This app is a simple R-Shiny APP that can be use the reactive funcitons and several other R-Shiny features. 
It takes 2 distributions (Normal, Gamma, Beta, Logistic, & Uniform) and displays the histograms, qq plot and KS Stat. 
I also included the binomial distribution for the sake of it. 

I'm still working some of the problems out, but it is a good reference for anyone looking to improve their R-Shiny skills
